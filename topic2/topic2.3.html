	<h3>Racial Discrimination</h3>
    <br>
	<p>occurs when a person is treated less favourably, or not given the same opportunities, 
	as others in a similar situation, because of their race, the country where they were born, their ethnic origin or their skin colour.<br>
	<br>
	Subtle forms of racial discrimination
    Subtle and subversive discrimination has also been identified as one of the most common ways racialized people experience unequal treatment. Subtle forms of discrimination can often only be detected upon examining all of the circumstances. 
	As well, contrasting how a racialized person was treated with how others were treated in a comparable situation, or looking for patterns of behaviour will help to determine whether subtle discrimination was at play.  While comments about race may sometimes be made, this is not necessary for a finding that subtle racial discrimination has occurred.  
	Racial discrimination need only be one of the reasons for the treatment received.There are many examples of subtle forms of racial discrimination.  In employment, it can take the form of failing to hire, train, mentor or promote a racialized person. Racialized persons may find themselves subjected to excessive performance monitoring or may be more seriously blamed for a common mistake. And, normal differences of opinion or failing to get along with a co-worker may be treated as more serious when a racialized person is involved.
    Subtle racial discrimination can occur in a variety of other contexts as well. In housing, racialized persons may be turned away as tenants, or may not be granted equal access to maintenance and repairs.  Issues also arise in services and facilities including malls, restaurants, movie theatres, education services and healthcare services.</p>
