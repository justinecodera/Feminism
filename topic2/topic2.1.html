	<h3>Age Discrimination</h3>
	<br>
	<p>occurs when a person is treated less favourably, or not given the same opportunities as others in a similar situation, because they are considered to be too old or too young.
	It also occurs when a rule or policy applies to everyone but disadvantages a person because of their age and the policy is not reasonable.<br><br>
	Age discrimination involves treating an applicant or employee less favorably because of his or her age.
    The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) forbids age discrimination against people who are age 40 or older. It does not protect workers under the age of 40, although some states have laws that protect younger workers from age discrimination. It is not illegal for an employer or other covered entity to favor an older worker over a younger one, even if both workers are age 40 or older.
    Discrimination can occur when the victim and the person who inflicted the discrimination are both over 40.
    Age Discrimination & Work Situations The law prohibits discrimination in any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoff, training, benefits, and any other term or condition of employment.</p>
