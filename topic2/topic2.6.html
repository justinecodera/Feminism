    <h3>Religious Discrimination</h3>
    <br>
	<p>Religious discrimination is valuing or treating people or groups differently because of what they do or do not believe in or because of their feelings towards a given religion.
	For instance, the Jewish population of Germany, and indeed a large portion of Europe, was subjected to discrimination under Adolf Hitler and his Nazi party between 1933 and 1945. They were forced to live in ghettos, wear an identifying star of David on their clothes,
	and sent to concentration and death camps in rural Germany and Poland, where they were to be tortured and killed, all because of their Jewish religion.</p>
