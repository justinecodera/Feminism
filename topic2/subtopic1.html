    <h3>How is equality and discrimination related to feminism on what terms?</h3>
	<br>
	<p>Equality and discrimination is really a big topic that is still happening today.
Feminism's aim to ensure the equal rights as well as the opportunities to all
women. While the equality, all the genders aim is to have a treatment without any
discrimination. And the discrimination is an unfair treatment to all people and
groups based on their characteristics, colour, height, skin, gender, and so on.<br><br>
Equality and discrimination is related to feminism because all of us are wanting to
have equality in our lives. Most of the time, women are being judged by others
because of their gender and also in the reason of, we grow up on the place that
told us women are only for the family or in homes, while men are the one who is
strong that needs to work for the family. For example, our ancestors' history is
that all of the women are not allowed to go to school nor to work the males job. In
that reason, feminism is related to discrimination that thinks women are weak
and cannot live for their own. It is also related to equality because of the
assumptions that men and women are different, by that feminism is based on
women having a freedom.<br><br>
In conclusion, equality feminist advocates for the equal rights and standing of
both men and women regardless of their religion, colour, height, gender, desires,
wants, and so on. Aside from that, feminism can be seen as a movement to end
the sexism, sexist exploitation, and to successfuly achieve full the gender
identity.</p>
