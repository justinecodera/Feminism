    <h3>Race, Gender, and Class Paradigm</h3>
	<br>
	<p>Race, Class, and Gender in the United States
       Race, class, and gender are connected categories of identity that influence many aspects of life in the United States. These categories, in their respective influences, structure people's experiences in society. 
       These social structures can feel more significant at any time of a person's life, and individuals feel their effects in society. Therefore, because of their existence simultaneously, researchers have provided
	   methods of analyzing race, class, and gender to understand their relationship.
       <br><br>
	   What is Race?<br>
       Defining the term race is not simple as a person's race is traditionally determined by the shared and inherited physical and ancestral qualities of a group, yet geneticists and sociologists have argued behavioral and 
	   geographical traits are determinants when identifying racial groups. Some definitions include cultural or ethnic traits that go beyond physical attributes, such as language, religion, values, and beliefs, making the term race more of a social construct.
	   <br><br>
	   What is Gender?<br>
       Gender is a social construct because it reflects societal attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors about a person's biological sex.
	   However, gender is an identity that may or may not connect to a person's biological sex. In other words, recent trends have seen that a person's biological sex may differ from a person's gender identity.
	   <br><br>
	   What is Class?<br>
       Class in society depicts the grouping of individuals according to their socioeconomic status.
	   The grouping is stratified based on factors like wealth, occupation, or education. 
	   It then follows that a higher class has more power and influence compared to the lower classes. 
	   Categorically speaking, social class can be divided into three sections: the upper class, middle class, and low class. 
	   Though the definitions of these terms are changing, the initial depiction of these classes was that higher classes had more wealth, education, and power in society. The low class lacked access to resources and opportunities of the middle and upper class.
	   The middle class depicted people that did not belong to a high class or low class. The term class was mostly used in the 19th century, and it depicted transitions in western societies after the industrial revolution.
