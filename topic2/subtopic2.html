    <h3>Women's experience during colonial America.</h3>
	<br>
	<p>Colonial America is the era where women faced different experiences. They were
discriminated against, no freedom and/or less rights compared to women's and
children today. Everything started when the first European women came to the
Southern colonies. It began here because it was headed by a man who presided
over his family and business while his wife only worked inside the home.<br><br>
As the Southern colonies became more established, society reverted to the
European model, and white women began focusing on running the household,
and managing servants and those they had enslaved. Women can only do
household chores, sewing, educating the children, producing soup, and many
more. Aside from that, they can also sometimes help their husbands' careers like
tavern owners, businessmen, or tradesmen. However, they are still not allowed to
vote who they want and no rights to share their opinions. In addition, children are
also victim of discrimination before. If a child is born rich or privileged, they can
learn etiquette, manners, hosting guests and so on, while a child is born in a
lower class, they need to help their mother produce soup, and so on.<br><br>
As a result, it shows here that even if you are born as a girl, as long as you have
the privilege you can have freedom in your life. While women’s born</p>
