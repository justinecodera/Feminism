    <h3>Why is the ERA not ratified?</h3>
	<br>
	<p>The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), a proposed amendment to the Constitution
       that ensures equal rights for women, was ratified by Virginia on January 15th,
       making it the most recent state to do so. After Democrats won over both
       chambers of the Virginia General Assembly for the first time in 20 years, the bill
       became a key legislative priority and the first female speaker of the state's House
       of Delegates was elected. The Constitution gives that corrections produce results
       when 3/4 of the states sanction them, putting the ongoing edge at 38 states.
       Virginia was the 38th state to endorse the Time since Congress proposed it in
       1972, actually pushing the Period across that limit. But, there are still obstacles in
       the Period's way. The confirmation cutoff times that Congress set after it
       supported the change have passed, and five states have acted to revoke their
       earlier endorsement. These bring up significant issues, and presently it really
       depends on Congress, the courts, and the American nation to determine them. <br><br>
	   
       Alice Paul and Crystal Eastman, two prominent members of the women's
       suffrage movement, first proposed the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923. The
       ERA was seen by supporters of women's rights as the next step after the
       successful effort to secure voting rights with the passage of the 19th
       Amendment.They thought that including the idea of gender equality into our
       founding document would help us get over many of the challenges that kept
       women on the margins of society. Starting in 1923, administrators presented the
       Period in each meeting of Congress, yet it gained little headway until the 1970s.
       It didn't help that for the greater part of the 20th hundred years, Congress was
       included essentially of men.<br><br>
	   
	   In the almost five-decade length somewhere in the
       range of 1922 and 1970, just 10 ladies served in the Senate, without any than 2
       serving simultaneously. The image was just somewhat better in the House.
       Notably, the ruling opposes the conclusion of the 1977 OLC opinion, which
       approved of the earlier extension of the ERA's ratification deadline. Instead, the
       opinion claims that the deadline established by Congress is binding and that the
       ERA "is no longer pending before the States." The National Archives and
       Records Administration has responded by stating that until a federal court gives
       an order, the United States archivist, Daniel Ferriero, will neither certify Virginia's
       ratification or add the ERA to the Constitution. (Ferriero had already approved
       the ratifications from Illinois and Nevada.)</p>
