    <h3>Definition of Equality</h3>
	<br>
	<p>The state of being equal, especially in status, rights, and opportunities.</p>
	<h3>What is Equality</h3>
	<p>Equality describes when people have the same opportunities, social status, and rights.
	The core principle of equality is that people should not be treated differently on the basis of their identity or self-identification (race, sex, gender, class, language, religion, age, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, and so forth).</p>
    <h3>History of Equality</h3>
	<p>The term equality has various origins, including Latin's aequalitatem, meaning similarity and equality. Inequality, the antonym of equality, occurs when individuals face discrimination on the basis of an identity. 
	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drawn up in 1948 following the horrors of World War II.</p>
	<h3>Types of Equality</h3>
	<ul>
    <li>Social equality
    Social equality refers to each individual's right to equal enjoyment of society and its many facets, such as equal access to job opportunities, education, and social activities.
    As a principle, social equality holds that no individual should be given priority over another based on their identity.</li><br>
    <li>Political equality
    Political equality refers to the equal right of individuals to participate in the political process, including the right to vote and the right to run for public office. 
	At first glance, one might assume that United States citizens enjoy political equality while voting rights are explicitly restricted</li><br>
    <li>Economic equality
    Economic equality refers to the right of individuals to be paid equally for the same job without regard to any characteristics that do not affect their job performance, 
	in other words, without regard to their gender, race, class, etc. One of the most salient examples of a lack of economic equality is the persistent wage gap between men and women.</li>
