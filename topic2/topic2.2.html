	<h3> Disability Discrimination </h3>
    <br>
    <p>occurs when a person is treated less favourably, or not given the same opportunities as others in a similar situation, because of their disability. 
     It can also occur when an unreasonable rule or policy is the same for everyone but has an unfair effect on people with a particular disability.<br><br>
	 <b>Who is responsible?</b><br>
     Anyone who discriminates against someone at work is responsible for their own actions.
     Employers can be held responsible too – this is called 'vicarious liability'.
     Employers also have a responsibility – a 'duty of care' – to look after the wellbeing of their employees. If an employer does not do this, in some cases it could lead to a serious breach of someone's employment contract. If an employee feels they have no choice to resign because of it, the employer could face a claim of constructive dismissal.
     All employers must take steps to prevent disability discrimination happening in the first place.
     By law, employers must also make reasonable adjustments for disabled employees and job applicants. If they do not do this, it could be discriminatory (the legal term is 'failure to make reasonable adjustments').
     Public sector organisations have an extra legal responsibility to stop discrimination, harassment and victimisation, under the public sector equality duty.</p>
