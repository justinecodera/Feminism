    <h3>Definition of Discrimination</h3>
	<br>
    <p>the <i>act, practice</i>, or an instance of discriminating categorically rather than individually</p>
	<h3>Etymology of Discrimination</h3>
	<br>
	<p>The term <b>discriminate</b> appeared in the early 17th century in the English language. It is from the Latin discriminat- 'distinguished between', from the verb discriminare, from discrimen 'distinction', from the verb discernere.
	Since the American Civil War the term "discrimination" generally evolved in American English usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable group or social category.
	Before this sense of the word became almost universal, it was a synonym for discernment, tact, and culture as in "taste and discrimination", generally a laudable attribute; to "discriminate against" being commonly disparaged.</p>
	
	<h3>What is Discrimination?</h3>
	<br>
	<p>Discrimination is the unfair or prejudicial treatment of people and groups based on characteristics such as race, gender, age or sexual orientation.
    'Direct discrimination' is when one person or a group of people is discriminated against because of their race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or other characteristics.
    ‘Indirect discrimination’ is when an unreasonable rule or policy applies to everyone but has the effect of disadvantaging some people because of a personal characteristic they share.
     Discrimination can be against the law if it is based on a person’s:</p>
