				• Philippine autochthonic communities acknowledge a girl as a Babaylan, somebody World Health Organization has the power to mediate with the mythical place, has her own spirit guides and is given gifts of healing, foretelling, and insight. She may be a ritualist, a chanter, diviner. Babaylans area unit referred to as by different names within the different languages of Philippine autochthonic communities: Mombaki, Dawac, Balyan or Balian, Katalonan, Ma-Aram, Mangngallag, Mumbaki, Mambunong. In different countries, they might be compared to shamans, "shaman-priest," or "priestesses." 
						<br>
					• Babaylan was the leader of the tribe within the pre-colonial Philippines. Second solely to the datu (head chief) within the social group hierarchy and acting as its authority in most matters regarding faith, medicine, natural phenomena, and others.
					<br>
					• The word babaylan may be a Bisayan term, originating from babai (woman) and therefore the classical Malay word belian/balian or waylan of Java, Bali, Borneo, and Kalmahera which implies 'spirit medium'.

				• They were valued so much, exalted, and treated with deference by the native people, even feared. Their word was received with great respect and their capabilities were held with awe. <br><br>

				• Female <i>datus</i> existed as well, and some remained in power because of the belief that they can harm enemies by magical means. The babaylan equally matched the tribal chief in this aspect, that they are sometimes considered rivals. But in most cases, they aided the datu in bringing down an enemy.<br><br>

				• The babaylan function as healers, seers, clairvoyants, exorcists, artists, teachers, agriculturists, philosophers, consultants, miracle workers, keepers of culture and tradition, or a combination of any of those rolled into one. Thus, the babaylan insures the institutionalization of traditional roles resulting in the stability and endurance of the social structures. <br><br>

				• When it came to healing, the babaylan would transcend human laws by invoking divine sources. The babaylan can select the spirits they admit into their bodies for specific purposes and therefore use their powers to heal.<br>

    	<div class="col">
      		<p class="tbody"> 	
				• To be a babaylan is a gift from the diwata (divine spirits), but these gifts come with a hefty price tag that manifested in dreams, visions, a lingering illness, or strange events happening to those who are chosen. They must follow the path of universal surrender by living out their lives in complete devotion to their community. <br><br>

		    	 • In preparation to respond to the Calling, a potential babaylan must first undergo a deep intense spiritual experience by absorbing the "self" into the beyond and achieved through meditation and prayers. There, she gets tutored on the craft by her ancestral spirits known as surog or gabay, who act as her supernatural sponsor and spirit guide. <br> <br>

		    	 •	This cosmic immersion is repeated in the performance of rites to become master of the elements, which is considered critical for the babaylan's mental and physical preparedness. The rituals consist of chants, offerings of food, and various symbolic materials accompanied by singing, dancing, and other forms of body movements meant to impress the spirits to get their favors. After a successful passage, she overcomes this state resulting in her being sensitive to psychic or supernatural forces. <br>

				A• Early Filipinos believe that each person has a dungan—the astral double or the soul, giving man vitality. The dungan is properly nurtured and strengthened by the babaylan to protect it from evil spirits that may capture or jest with it, causing the person to be sick.<br><br>

		    	 • If a dungan is lured or captured by these spirits, it can still be persuaded to return by the babaylan through offerings and negotiations with the enraged or hostile entities that are possibly offended by unintended misdemeanors or intrusions to their sacred habitat. <br> <br>

		    	 •	A babaylan is also well-versed in herb lore and used in diagnosing or treating a sick individual. They create remedies, antidotes, and potions with the help of spirit guides and living elder babaylan. <br><br>

		    	 • If after all these possible methods are done and the person is still sick, the babaylan will then engage in a spiritual battle with the spirits as a last resort. This can be done by invoking more powerful beings for their assistance. Usually, the babaylan has to earn the help of a diwata by accomplishing a specific task or challenge. <br>

				•The term babaylan denotes that offerers to the gods were limited to women, leading some to interpret this role as a corruption of the local term babayi lang which means 'women only' and implies its gender exclusivity. As well as the Kiniray-a term bayi/baylan used to refer to female grand elders. It viewed babaylan as a sisterhood of women with special powers. But contrary to popular belief, not all babaylan were females.<br><br>

		    	 •Before the Spaniards came, the Tagalog natives of Luzon praised an almighty god named Bathala. Its name specifically could be broken down to highlight the importance of equal gender roles. The “ba” comes from babae (female), the “la” from lalake (male), and the “ha” means spirit. Therefore, the Filipino god is neither man nor woman. It is simply a spirit that encompasses and represents the characteristics of both genders. <br> <br>

		    	 •	A babaylan can be a male, female, or feminized man and hermaphrodite known as Asog in the Visayas. <br><br>

		    	 •	Male priests called bayoc who dressed like females. The term bayoc is close to the Cebuano “bayot” which refers to a male homosexual. Did the “agi” or “bayoc” define a male gender that was more female-like? Did the “agi” or “bayot” perhaps evolve from this asog or bayoc gender phenomenon of the babaylan? The asog or bayoc concept further raises more tickling questions. What was the folk's perception of male homosexuality? Was male homosexuality accepted and tolerated in early Filipino society because of its link to the babaylan role? Is it because of this cultural link in the past that Filipino male homosexuals today tend to have closer friendly ties with females? <br><br>

		    	 •	Asog was considered deficient in the performance of his role as a male and thus deficient in matrimony. This might have lowered his worth or value in a society that expects males to enter matrimony and beget children. But it was also this deficiency in his being more female which qualified him into the babaylan sisterhood. As a babaylan, the asog raises his worth and gains honor in a society that might have been unwelcome for his kind. <br><br>

		    	 • The entry of the male gender through the asog phenomenon and his eventual acceptance as babaylan perhaps served as a transition for the eventual male babaylan “takeover”. <br>

				• With colonial rule came the Roman Catholic religion, which resulted in the persecution of the native priestesses.
				The babaylan were punished and their idols were confiscated and burned to wipe out their pagan practices. Nevertheless, vestiges of the native religion persisted and its followers troubled the ecclesiastical and civil authorities.<br><br>

		    	• When forced to abandon their indigenous beliefs, the babaylan used Catholic images and rituals as their anitos and diwatas. But those who refused to submit fled to the mountains where they were branded as witches, now feared and despised by the natives. <br> <br>

		    	•	In the years 1580-1590, Muslims invaded Panay island. So the babaylan took advantage of the situation and rallied the people to return to their native faith led by Dupinagay, Monica Gapon, and Agustina Hiticon—but their efforts failed.
				It was reported that 180 "diabolical women" gathered to preach the old faith and disturbed the town of Sibalom in Antique province. <br><br>

		    	 • The only female babaylan that claimed noteworthy attention during this period was Estrella Bangotbanwa also known as “Tagasod Kang Kalibutan” (Caretaker of the World), who invoked heavy rains that ceased the drought which nearly perished the towns of Miago and San Joaquin, Iloilo.
				Part of the Panay island in the Western Visayas are the Iloilo and Antique provinces, the known stronghold of the babaylan. Today, these places including Siquijor island are regarded as mystical and full of witches. <br><br>

				• Male babaylan who were allegedly homosexuals also led revolutions to throw off the Spanish yoke. <br><br>

				• Heroic figures like Tapara—a babaylan from Iloilo in 1663, who dressed and acted like a woman; Ponciano Elofre, later known as 'Dios Buhawi' (Tornado/Whirlwind God) of Negros Oriental in 1887; Gregorio Lampinio, secondary leader of the Pulahan group—a religious revival cult in 1897, and Papa Isio of Negros Occidental.
				Their primary agenda was religious freedom and agrarian reform because most adherents of the babaylan revolution were dispossessed landowners, thrown off their property by the Spanish hacienderos and friars bent on acquiring land.<br>

				• Women in the pre-colonial Philippines enjoyed nearly equal status with men. Prior to colonization, both men and women could get a divorce for the following reasons: failure to meet family obligations, childlessness, and infidelity. Children, regardless of gender, and property were equally divided in a divorce.<br><br>

		    	 • PH ranks first in Asia for gender diversity in the workforce <br> <br>

		    	 •	MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines ranked first overall in gender diversity in the workforce among 10 Asian countries, according to the 2019 Gender Diversity Benchmark for Asia (GDBA) report by Hong Kong-based nonprofit organization Community Business. <br><br>

		    	 • The country emerged with the best diversity performance by averaging 3 indicators: women's representation in the total workforce; representation at the senior level; and the pay gap.
