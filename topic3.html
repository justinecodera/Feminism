				• The term “woman emancipation” is thus generally used to refer to the process by which women in general and poor women in particular are made to gain access and control of all forms of resources in a nation. It is a movement which aims at ensuring freedom of self-fulfillment and self-development for women, as well as equal access to domestic and community resources.<br><br>
				•Process, strategy and myriad efforts by which women have been striving to liberate themselves from the authority and control of men and traditional power structures, as well as to secure equal rights for women, remove gender discrimination from laws, institutions and behavioural patterns, and set legal standards that shall promote their full equality with men.

					•Throughout the years, women have fought for their rights. Olympe de Gouges' The Declaration of the Rights of Women and the Female Citizen, which became one of the foundations of the first wave of feminism in the mid-19th century; and Mary Wolstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, which was purely controversial yet still fought for women's rights. It began with the rise of the women's suffrage movement in America, where women fought for their right to vote and their right to participate in male labor. The Suffragettes made steady entry through the American West, where they gave the right to vote to women, including those in British colonies. The Suffragettes became so embedded that they became militant and committed acts of violence. A few suffragette groups also started celebrating International Women's Day and continued through out the war. The first was February 28th, and was officially adopted as a holiday when Soviet Russia did so in 1918. The 19th amendment was ratified to further strengthen the rights of women.

				• It is the right of women by law to vote in national or local elections. Women were excluded from voting in ancient Greece and republican Rome, as well as in the few democracies that had emerged in Europe by the end of the 18th century. When the franchise was widened, as it was in the United Kingdom in 1832, women continued to be denied all voting rights.

				• Anti-suffrage views dominated among men and women through the early twentieth century. They argued that most women did not want the vote. Because they took care of the home and children, they said women did not have time to vote or stay updated on politics. Some argued women lacked the expertise or mental capacity to offer a useful opinion about political issues. Others asserted that women’s votes would simply double the electorate; voting would cost more without adding any new value.<br><br>

				• Before organizing, suffrage opponents bonded without an official institution. Artists created political cartoons that mocked suffragists. Religious leaders spoke out against women’s political activism from the pulpit. Articles attacked women who took part in public life. Even without a coordinating institution, opposition to suffrage remained popular.

				• The 1830s and 1840s was an era of reform and revival for the United States. In the wake of the spiritual renewal of the Second Great Awakening, many were demanding religious and societal change in order to provide for marginalized people. Women took a leadership role in reform efforts, tackling a broad range of issues from prisons to education to the abolition of slavery. <br><br>

				• Some historians have even labeled the period from 1830 to 1850 as the “Age of Reform.” Women, in particular, played a major role in these changes. Key movements of the time fought for women’s suffrage, limits on child labor, abolition, temperance, and prison reform.

      			• In the early 20th century, most women in the United States did not work outside the home, and those who did were primarily young and unmarried. In that era, just 20 percent of all women were “gainful workers,” as the Census Bureau then categorized labor force participation outside the home, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such. Of course, these statistics somewhat understate the contributions of married women to the economy beyond housekeeping and childrearing, since women’s work in the home often included work in family businesses and the home production of goods, such as agricultural products, for sale. Also, the aggregate statistics obscure the differential experience of women by race. African American women were about twice as likely to participate in the labor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to remain in the labor force after marriage. <br><br>

				• Since the beginning of the women’s rights movement, women who devoted their lives to reform often were middle- and upper-class women. the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, however, working women began supporting suffrage in greater numbers. They joined labor unions, held strikes for higher pay, and protested for better working conditions. Working women started seeing the vote as a way to gain more political power to further these causes.
