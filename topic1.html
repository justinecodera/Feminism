				• Belief in the social, economic, and political equality of the sexes is known as feminism. Feminism, which mostly developed in the West, has a global presence and is represented by a number of organizations dedicated to advancing the rights and interests of women. Feminism is the belief that society prioritizes the male point of view and that women are treated unjustly. Efforts to change this include fighting against gender stereotypes and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women that are equal to those for men. 
					<br><br>
					• Feminists have been campaigning for women's rights since the 19th century, including the right to vote, run for public office, and earn equal pay. They have also worked to ensure access to contraception, legal abortions, and social integration. Changes in female dress standards and acceptable physical activities have often been part of feminist movements. Women were not allowed to study, possess property, or participate in public life in medieval Europe. They were still required to cover their heads in public at the end of the 19th century in France, and a husband could still legally sell his wife in some of Germany.
					<br><br>
					• In Europe and the majority of the United States (where numerous territories and states granted women's suffrage long before the federal government did so), women were still prohibited from voting and from holding electoral office as late as the early 20th century. Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be the main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights. Feminist theory aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience. Some argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims, because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.

				• Many consider Mary Wollstonecraft to be the founder of feminism because of her 1792 book, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, in which she argues for women's education. The term "feminism" is credited to French philosopher and utopian socialist Charles Fourier, who first used it in 1837. First recorded in France and the Netherlands in 1872, followed by Great Britain in the 1890s and the United States in 1910, the terms "féminisme" and "féministe" (feminist) are now widely used. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this meaning first appeared in English in 1895. Feminists all over the world have pursued various causes and objectives depending on the historical period, culture, and nation. Most feminist historians in the west argue that all movements fighting for women's rights should be regarded as feminist movements, even if they did not (or do not) self-identify as such.  <br><br>

				• The so-called "second wave" of feminism, or the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s, marked a seemingly sudden break from the idyllic suburban existence portrayed in American popular culture. However, the dissatisfaction of college-educated moms, whose discontent drove their daughters in a new direction, was at the heart of the new rebellion. The third wave was made feasible by the second wave's women's increased economic and professional power and position, the information revolution of the late 20th century's huge expansion of options for the diffusion of ideas, and the maturation of Generation X academics and activists. Many assert that a fourth wave of feminism began around 2012, however this is controversial for some. This wave focused on themes such as rape culture, body shaming, and sexual harassment. Utilizing social media to bring these issues to light and solve them was a crucial element.<br>

				• Feminist ethics emerged as an academic field of study in the field of philosophy in the 1970s, when philosophical journals began to publish articles specifically concerned with feminism and sexism (Korsmeyer 1973; Rosenthal 1973; Jaggar 1974), and after curricular programs of Women's Studies were established in some universities (Young 1977; Tuana 2011).  The goal of feminist ethics is to change or reformulate those parts of traditional western ethics that minimize or devalue the moral experience of women. Feminist philosopher Alison Jaggar blames conventional western ethics for failing women in five interconnected ways, among others.  <br><br>

		    	 • First of all, it demonstrates insufficient regard for the rights and interests of women in comparison to those of men. The issues that emerge in the so-called private sphere, where women cook, clean, and take care of the young, aged, and sick, are secondly dismissed as ethically irrelevant. Third, it implies that women's moral development is generally less advanced than men. Fourth, it undervalues culturally feminine features like interdependence, community, connection, body, emotion, nature, immanence, peace, and life while overvaluing culturally male traits like independence, autonomy, separation, mind, reason, culture, transcendence, war, and death. Fifth, it supports culturally male approaches to moral reasoning that place an emphasis on laws, universality, and impartiality over traditionally feminine approaches that place an emphasis on connections, particularity, and partiality. <br>

		    	 • Discussions about the purportedly gendered nature of morality and feminist approaches to ethics are not recent trends. Mary Wollstonecraft, an eighteenth-century philosopher, said that men's and women's moralities are fundamentally the same in response to the kinds of queries regarding "women's morality" raised above. Wollstonecraft disagreed that women are inherently more lustful than males, despite the fact that she did not utilize phrases like "socially-constructed gender roles" to make her point. According to her logic, if men were kept in the same cages that women are, like low-ranking military personnel, they would grow to be just as weak-willed as women. <br> <br>

		    	 •	It is evident that female-centered philosophers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to think of morality as gendered. Morality has historically been seen as being gendered. Determining whether a gendered understanding of morality is accurate is crucial since thinkers who focus on women in the 20th century also frequently think of morality as gendered. The majority of thinkers who have advanced a woman-centered approach to ethics have rejected the ontological assumptions that the more one is from others, the more developed one is, as well as the epistemological assumptions that the more universal, abstract, objective, and rational knowledge is, the more accurately it reflects reality. <br>

				•For the past fifty years, feminist ethics has been the focus of philosophical inquiry in (at first) Western and (increasingly) international discourse. Theorists have thought about metaethical, theoretical, and practical issues. In the 1970s and 1980s, discussions critically reexamined issues that had vexed scholars for centuries, particularly those pertaining to moral actors' innate (and gendered) capacity for moral deliberation. The question of whether and why there might be appreciable distinctions between the care and justice priorities of men and women is a crucial one in moral theory. During this time, questions are raised and continue to be raised concerning feminist approaches to articulating ethical theories. These discussions can be found in the intersectionality literature, Black feminist theory, women of color feminism, transnational feminism, queer theory, disability studies, and feminist ethics criticism of the twenty-first century. Particularly alarming to them is the tendency of feminist ethicists to endorse gender binary thinking and crude categorizations of women. <br><br>

		    	 •Every ten years, issues about the flaws of conventional ethical theories, the characteristics of morally upright conduct in oppressive environments, and the types of ethical theories most likely to eradicate gendered oppression and evils give rise to critical scholarship. There is no single, comprehensive definition of femininity or the term "feminism" that can be used to describe all females. An ethics of care draws our attention to the importance of relationship responsiveness (paying attention, listening, and responding) as well as the consequences associated with cutting ties with oneself or others. <br> <br>

		    	 •	Instead of using deductive or mathematical reasoning, it uses inductive, contextual, psychological reasoning. Morality has its roots in human interactions because they give rise to worries about injustice and negligence. Morality is based on a psychological logic that reflects the manner in which we see ourselves in relation to others. It is also critical to make clear that, in a patriarchal framework, the ethics of care is a "feminine" ethic, whereas in a democratic framework, it is a human ethic based on fundamental democratic principles, such as the significance of everyone having a voice and being attentively and respectfully heard. <br>

				• In conclusion, women were not treated equally in the past since men dominated society. They are being delayed and given fewer chances to succeed and pursue their desires. Because they are compelled to act in a way that benefits males, women are unable to realize even a small portion of their dreams. This is how feminism got its start. Feminists struggle for the equality of all people, regardless of gender, believing that everyone deserves the same opportunities in life. Although feminist ethics began as an area of study, it has evolved into a movement that includes some males, particularly writers of feminism-related literature. The goal of feminist ethics is to modify how men should treat women morally and to promote equality rather than supremacy in feminism. Feminism is an essential movement to support women, but there are also others who exploit it. Some women are utilizing feminism to their advantage in order to more easily achieve their goals in life. <br><br>

		    	• To safeguard women and ensure their equality with males in the future, feminism attempts to solve a variety of concerns pertaining to women. Although there isn't a universally accepted definition of feminism, every race, age group, and female have their own ideas about what it means to struggle for various forms of equality in order to address their own problems. According to Wollstonecraft's assertion, men and women are equally qualified to pursue their goals in life, with the exception that men have received more opportunities to do so than women. That assertion is accurate since we all start out with nothing, and it is through experiences and opportunities that we grow as people. Without these, we are compelled to act in ways that were only taught to us. In today's society, many women are in positions of leadership thanks to the success of feminism ethics in assisting women. <br>
